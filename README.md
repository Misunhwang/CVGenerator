# CVGenerator
CV Generator for Future Skill's Project

If job seekers have little work experience, writing their CV will be very difficult. Then, would it be easier to write a CV if they have a lot of work experience? If they have a lot of experience in a field, they will be able to write their CV with confidence. However, if they have experience in various fields, they will have to rewrite the CV only with work experience in the field they are applying for, so it will be surprisingly difficult. Sometimes, when they are filling out their CV, they lose their opportunity because they do not submit it on time. 

In this project, I built a web application that automatically generates CV based on the role which users are applying for. The system allows users to view job-specific CV and print out them as standardized documents. The target users of this system are job seekers with experience in various fields.
